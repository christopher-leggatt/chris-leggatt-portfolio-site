        I'm Chris, a full stack developer and <PopoverLink href={customMetadata.codepen}>creative coder</PopoverLink>, transitioning from
        the world of automotive manufacturing and quality control. My journey
        has been driven by a lifelong passion for learning and an innate ability
        to adapt and solve problems, a trait I've honed due to my <PopoverLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constriction_ring_syndrome">limb differences.</PopoverLink>
        These experiences have not just shaped my approach to
        challenges but also fueled my curiosity in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career in the industrial sector, spanning nearly two decades, has
        been foundational in developing my troubleshooting skills, team-building
        abilities, and a robust work ethic. However, the physical demands of the
        industry prompted me to seek a new path, one that aligns with my
        deep-seated interests in both technical and creative domains.

          I've always been intrigued by the intersection of technology and
          creativity, finding joy in sketching, drumming, and reading. The world
          of coding and computer science, once a distant fascination, became a
          tangible goal as I dabbled in <PopoverLink href={experience![1].company_url}>online coding modules</PopoverLink> and began building
          my first projects. This exploration led me to enroll in BrainStation's
          <PopoverLink href="https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp">Software Engineering course - </PopoverLink>one of the best decisions I've ever made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intensive program at BrainStation was a catalyst in my
          development. It deepened my understanding of object-oriented
          programming, full-stack development, and project workflow. It also
          equipped me with a clear vision for my future in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I'm <PopoverLink href={customMetadata.linkedin}>#opentowork,</PopoverLink> enthusiastic about embarking on new projects
          and collaborations. I am eager to dive into new programming languages,
          connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community, and hone
          my code-jutsu. With my blend of industrial experience and fresh
          software engineering skills, I am ready to contribute, learn, and grow
          in this new chapter of my career ðŸ˜Š
